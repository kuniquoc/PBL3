At first it was named the Henry Parmenties Museum.&nbsp;The museum is officially known as the Museum of Champa Sculpture. The kingdom of Champa (or Lin-yi in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central Vietnam from approximately 192 through 1697. The empire began to decline in the late 15th century, became a Vietnamese vassal state in 1697, and was finally dissolved in 1832.

They were then displayed at Le Jardin de Tourane on a small hill by the Han River. This is the site of the present museum.</p><p>The building was&nbsp;designed by two French architects, Delaval and Auclair, in imitation of the most commonly used aspects of Champa towers and temples.</p><p>At present, the museum displays approximately&nbsp;300 sandstone and terra-cotta sculptures, among which some are made from terracotta. Most of the artifacts are masterpieces of Champa art and some are considered to be equal to works anywhere in the world. The sculptures were collected from Cham temples and towers throughout Central Vietnam, more specifically the area stretching from Quang Binh to Binh Thuan. <em>All the sculptures are displayed in 10 showrooms named after the localities where the pieces have been discovered.

It is like a giant dragon, lying on Highway 1 on the border between Thua Thien-Hue&nbsp;and&nbsp;Danang City. This is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the highest pass in Vietnam&nbsp;(500m above sea level). This rugged pass is the final section of the Truong Son Range stretching to the sea. Hai Van means “Sea Clouds”, since the peak of the mountain is in the clouds while its foot is close to the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Hai Van Pass was known as the Thuan Hoa and Quang Nam frontier.</p><h2><strong>2. History of Hai Van Pass</strong></h2><p>In the early 14th century (1306), Che Man, a king from Cham Pa, offered two mountainous administrative units of O and Ri as engagement gifts to Princess Huyen Tran, daughter of King Tran Nhan Tong. Since then, Hai Van Pass has acted as the physical boundary between Dai Viet and Cham Pa. Until now, on top of the pass, you can still see the ancient grand gate which used to be one of the border crossings between two kingdoms. During the Vietnamese-American War, people called Hai Van Pass the ‘Street Without Joy’ since it connected Hue and Da Nang – the most significantly war-ravaged cities at the time.</p>', 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C4%90%C3%A8o+H%E1%BA%A3i+V%C3%A2n/@16.1999995,108.1230332,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x31422151a4984555:0x9a66217b26b3f759!8m2!3d16.2!4d108.133333!16s%2Fm%2F02rnk9y?entry=ttu', '2024-06-11 23:39:04'),
