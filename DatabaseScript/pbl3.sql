Overview of Hai Van Pass</strong></h2><p>On the north – south nation highway, Hai Van Pass is an impressive landscape. It is like a giant dragon, lying on Highway 1 on the border between Thua Thien-Hue&nbsp;and&nbsp;Danang City. This is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the highest pass in Vietnam&nbsp;(500m above sea level). This rugged pass is the final section of the Truong Son Range stretching to the sea. Hai Van means “Sea Clouds”, since the peak of the mountain is in the clouds while its foot is close to the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Hai Van Pass was known as the Thuan Hoa and Quang Nam frontier.</p><h2><strong>2. History of Hai Van Pass</strong></h2><p>In the early 14th century (1306), Che Man, a king from Cham Pa, offered two mountainous administrative units of O and Ri as engagement gifts to Princess Huyen Tran, daughter of King Tran Nhan Tong. Since then, Hai Van Pass has acted as the physical boundary between Dai Viet and Cham Pa. Until now, on top of the pass, you can still see the ancient grand gate which used to be one of the border crossings between two kingdoms. During the Vietnamese-American War, people called Hai Van Pass the ‘Street Without Joy’ since it connected Hue and Da Nang – the most significantly war-ravaged cities at the time.</p>', 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C4%90%C3%A8o+H%E1%BA%A3i+V%C3%A2n/@16.1999995,108.1230332,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x31422151a4984555:0x9a66217b26b3f759!8m2!3d16.2!4d108.133333!16s%2Fm%2F02rnk9y?entry=ttu', '2024-06-11 23:39:04'),
